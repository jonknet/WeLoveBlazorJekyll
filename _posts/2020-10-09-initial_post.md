Welcome! My name is Jon and I am designing this site to be a central hub of information for learning Blazor. I still have a lot of work to do and am always looking for feedback. If you can think of any, either post to the forum (link is on the top navbar) or use the feedback link to send me an email directly. Your contribution will be much appreciated!
